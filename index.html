      <p>Pam Weissman is a Social Worker in Private Practice in Baltimore, Maryland. Originally from Metuchen, New Jersey, Pam was raised in a very loving home, but like most of us, it was filled with all kinds of chaos as well. One of the greatest gifts of her life was having her Grandmother live in her house with Pam and her three older brothers, mother and father. 

       <br> <br>
        “My grandmother brought many of the features highlighted in the book to life: humor, nurturance and stability, for starters, and my parents taught me a great deal as it pertains to respecting others and being there for others. They seemed to carry whatever the opposite of cynicism is and looked at the world with awe like that of the Beginner’s Mind of a young child.”
        
        
        <br> <br>
        Pam and her husband, Neil have raised four children, themselves all adults, partnered, professionals and parents. Each member of her family has served as a driving force toward the creation of Your World. 
        
        
        <br> <br>
        Per Pam, “I see the mistakes I have made in my life but I see the power of reconciliation and communication. I see life as that of climbing a mountain. The higher up you go, the better the view. So this book comes with heart but also a great deal of perspective.”

<Strong>Endorsements: </Strong><br>

“Your World is breathtakingly beautiful. It has the effect of letting warm sunshine into a darkened room. It is part a work of writing, part a work of art, and all a work of soul. Love leaps off of every page, and to experience this book is to take an emotional journey that is fueled by joy and that ends up with hope.”

-David Hackam, MD, Surgeon-In-Chief, Johns Hopkins Children’s Hospital

<br><br>

“A beautiful and important book. As the reader is gently invited to grapple with some of the more tragic moments in our history, as well as the challenges we face in our interactions with others, the author lovingly reassures us that we can navigate even the most difficult experiences when we are securely attached, comforted, and connected to others. Everything in life’s more manageable when we don’t have to face it alone.-a powerful reminder to children and adults alike.” 

-LIsa Ferentz, LCSW-C DAPA, author of Finding Your Ruby Slippers: Transformative Life Lessons From the Therapist’s Couch

<br><br>

“Your World will bring families together. Weissman opens the door of discussion when there is personal, familial or societal loss, because it is suffused with not only warmth, but also tenderness and insight. The beautiful imagery adds to the experience and helps parents, teachers and children talk openly. It is a treasure benefitting children of all ages.”

-Jack Gladstein, MD, Professor of Pediatrics, Executive Vice Chair, University of Maryland, School of Medicine

  <h3 class="w3-center">FAQ:  About YOUR WORLD</h3>
  <div class="w3-row">
    
  <p class="w3-left">


 Q: <br>

Pam, this book is not exactly typical. It is not only for children, but parents and teachers. For all of us. 

It has the feel of a children’s book even though the text shifts and becomes more mature.

Can you speak to that? <br>



A:<br>

Sure. The most important quality of any book is to know who it is for, which is why on the cover, boldly it is written, “A Book of Comfort for Parents, Teachers and Caregivers to Benefit Kids of all ages.



Your World is meant to serve as a source of comfort, truly for anyone.  It reminds us that where there is life there will often be burdens and extreme challenges. 



It also offers that we internalize the beauty and bounty of our universe and to think about what we each deserve-ideally from the ones we love and from those in our orbit. And also from ourselves. We can give ourselves compassion and understanding. 

I would like everyone to believe that we have what it takes to breathe in, ultimately, peace of mind. 

The messages are FROM adults TO children and FOR adults as well. 


<br><br>
Q: <br>

Tell us about how the beautiful text and illustrations came together.<br>



A:<br>

The illustrations are like the music and the text is like the lyrics of a song. 

As Alli, the illustrator and I collaborated, we discovered how the words and the pictures informed each other. The collaboration was unforgettable. I loved every minute! 



As a result (gotta share this!) here are some of the comments received:

A 16 year old client said, “This book is like drinking a warm cup of tea next to a dimmed light with a warm blanket at night.” 



A nine year old read it and asked Alli Fisher, “Is this what grown ups are supposed to do?” 



A 48 year old client cried in session after she read it and said, “This is what I need to read along with my teen daughter.” 



A 57 year old acquaintance commented, 

“Pam, I read it slowly. That’s the only way to truly absorb it all.”





<br><br>

Q:<br>

Walk us through the process, how you originally envisioned Your World.<br>

A: <br>

Originally, from the day of its inception, Your World was meant to be a book f o r 

children. Not a children’s book, per se. 

I did, yes, have a vision for it. 



And that is due to an experience I had with my oldest granddaughter. 

She was three years old at the time. (She is a teenager now!)



She came home from school one day (or was it a play date?) and she seemed really upset, almost confused. She and her mom and I were in the kitchen. 

We asked what happened. What went wrong? And as she began to explain in her three y/o language that something went wrong with a friend, I immediately thought to myself, “Here it comes. Welcome to the world. You have been officially disappointed by someone else. Oh boy, is there ever more of that to come your way!” 



When I saw the confusion in her eyes and the loss of innocence begin to seep in, I heard myself think- “But we are here for you. Even though the world can be rough at times, Your World does not have to be.” 

And then, I had images of all the things she would be exposed to and all the history she would learn. And that broke my heart!



I then made a mental pledge of my allegiance as a mother and as a grandmother. 



That very night I wrote the book in my head and in the morning ran over to my laptop. I needed her and her siblings and cousins and all the children, yes, in the whole wide world to know that several inevitabilities were coming their way. 

But, with it all, we got their backs. <br><br>



Q:<br> We have each others backs? <br>



A: <br>

I think of this book as a “Declaration of Dependance”. We live in a world where individualism is highly emphasized and concepts such as “being true to yourself” and not to worry what others think, a “you do you” kind of world is encouraged. 

And that can be very liberating in many ways.



The message here is a bit different though. It is saying that we really need each other. 

I believe in a society of interdependence- to care for each other, to look after one another, to care how others see us, to provide a sense of acceptance and, most importantly, that of a solid attachment. It is basic biology.

Our presence in each other’s lives is to be celebrated. Dependence is all part of a give and give society. 

<br><br>

Q: <br>

I see. What about the historical traumas that you reference?


<br>
A: <br>

We are all privy, as members of humanity, to historical trauma to some degree. However, when someone is born as the offspring or descendant of an ancestor that experienced traumas such as slavery or any form of genocide, or any of the abuses, there is a transmission of those traumatic experiences. 

You can call it transgenerational trauma as well, such as, again, descendants of slavery.



The dehumanization of a society creates a trickle down effect from one generation to the next. And to the next. 



Also, even if we did not experience the historical traumas through our ancestry, we can feel them with compassion vicariously. 



As an example, I am not a second generation child of Holocaust survivors but I am educated in that area as a member of my faith. And I promise you, I am forever impacted. Quite indelibly. 

<br><br>



Q: <br>

How did you choose the three events for Your World?<br>

A:<br>

When I was eight years old, and in the 2nd grade, Martin Luther King Jr. was tragically assassinated. The news reached my school and I will never forget the expression on my teacher’s face. My classmates and I picked up her cues that this was a watershed moment in our history. I learned then, and life has confirmed, that we all need to be well-aware of the deleterious impact of racism and honor those that stand up against it. 



In addition the message here is -Children are highly impressionable. 

And-Teachers are big Influencers. Second to parents, the biggest. 

<br><br>

Q:<br>

What about Memorial Day and International Holocaust Remembrance Day?<br>

A:<br>

I feel we have to know what war heroes/veterans do for each of our countries-men and women on the front lines, that they are protecting us and not take their efforts for granted. 

Peace and safety, sadly, come at a cost. For some families, a grave cost.



On a personal note, this section (Memorial Day in the U.S. or Remembrance Day elsewhere) is my way of paying homage to my father in law who served in the Battle of Normandy in France during WWII as a 17 year old. His courage was, like thousands of others, incomparable. 



In addition, my husband has had the honor of working for over 30 years with veterans of the Armed Services. As a result, we have a greater appreciation of the sacrifices made by these men and women.



I chose International Holocaust Remembrance Day because I have an agenda. And that is to recognize that in the world hate and evil exist and need to be courageously confronted. This is a scary reality. The Holocaust was the greatest crime committed against humanity in the 20th century-perhaps ever.



I want to add that I hope that families and teachers feel free to insert events in history or current events that speak to them - to make this book all the more so, one’s own. 

<br><br>

Q: <br>

Word has it that “Your World” was not the original title. <br>

A:<br>

Yes! The title was originally “You are Holding the Book of Love.”

I wanted the actual object, the book itself to act as a soothing source of comfort.

That, just by reading it, by holding it, one can feel a sense of security. Almost a take-along transitional object as one goes along in life. 



Ultimately, one night I was trying to come up with a better title, when my husband calmly asked, “What about Your World?” I screamed, “YES, YES!”  

I am very dependent upon him ;))))<br><br></p><br>

<!--  
Q:<br>
Pam, this book is not exactly typical. It is for parents and teachers, but it is illustrated.
It has the feel of a children’s book even though the content is rather mature.
Can you speak to that? <br>
A:<br>
Great question. And believe me, I am aware of this. The most important quality of any book is to
know who it is for, which is why on the cover boldly written it says, “A Book of Comfort for
Parents, Teachers and Caregivers to Benefit Kids of all ages.”
It is a book for all of us in one way or another.
And I am happily guilty of producing that.
Your World is meant to serve as a source of comfort, truly for anyone.
Let’s say, you are feeling down. It tells you that, life is hard and the challenges are guaranteed.
But it also asks that you internalize what we each deserve-ideally from the ones we love and in
our orbit, but even from ourselves. We can give ourselves compassion and understanding. We
have what it takes to breathe in peace of mind.
<br> <br>
Q:<br>
But it is illustrated! <br>
A:<br>
Ha! Wait! Is that an accusation? Ha!
Seriously, If you think about it, what is an adult? A child with more responsibilities! We still have
many of the same needs for connection and peace of mind.
So, why can’t adults enjoy an illustrated book? Right? So many parenting books, which are
phenomenal and can become game changers are great if you have the sitzfleisch to sit through
them.
Your World is a soothing experience. And it’s many messages and lessons are straight and to
the point. And serve as food for thought. And besides, those illustrations by Alli Fisher are
gorgeous. Enjoy and meditate them internally. Go for it!
A 16 year old client of mine read it and said, “It is like drinking a warm cup of tea with a warm
blanket.” A nine year old read it and said, “This is what grown up are supposed to do.”
Sorry, but anyone can learn from it. I am still trying to ;)))
<br> <br>
Q:<br>
Walk us through the process, how you originally envisioned Your World.
<br>
A:<br>
Originally, from the day of its inception, Your World was meant to be a book f o r
children. Not a children’s book, per se. I did, yes, have a vision for it.

And that is because of my oldest granddaughter.
She was three years old at the time. (She is a teenager now. Gulp.)<br> <br>

Q:<br>
Your granddaughter? Ha. Say more.<br>
A:<br>
She comes home from school one day (or was it a play date?) and she was really sad. She and
her mom and I were in the kitchen as she talked about something that went wrong with her
young friend.
I immediately thought to myself, “Here it comes. Welcome to the world. You have been officially
disappointed by someone else. Oh boy, is there ever more of that to come your way!”
It was not a big deal per se but I could see the confusion in her eyes and the beginning of the
loss of innocence begin to seep in.
I then heard myself think- “But we are here for you. Even though the world can be rough at
times, Your World, does not have to be.”
So, that night I wrote the book in my head and in the morning ran over to my laptop. I needed
her and her siblings and cousins and all the children, yes, in the whole wide world to know that
several inevitabilities were coming their way.
And with it all, we got their backs.
<br> <br>
Q:<br>
I see. Such as the historical traumas that you reference?<br>
A:<br>
You got it- plus more. We are all privy, as members of humanity, to life’s many challenges and
also, to historical trauma. You can call it transgenerational trauma as well, such as descendants
of slavery.
In broad terms, many are victims themselves and many are descendants of victims. And they
wear that pain as well.
But this is not just about victimhood. Imagine being a culprit or the descendant of a criminal.
Think about what it is like to be a descendant of a Nazi? Just as an example. Or someone
whose family is part of a White Supremacist group. Or has a clear history of enslavement.
Something to ponder.
Also, even if we did not experience the historical traumas through our ancestry, we can feel
them with compassion vicariously.
As an example, I am not a second generation child of Holocaust survivors but I am educated in
that area as a member of my faith. And I promise you, I am forever impacted.
<br> <br>
Q:<br>
You choose the word “trauma” to describe these events.<br>
A:<br>
Ya, I do. There is history there.
One day, while receiving supervision with a group of psychotherapy colleagues, all of us
facilitating groups for survivors of childhood abuse or domestic violence, I heard myself say, I
think we tend to use the word Trauma too readily. When one colleague looked me square in the
eyes, and said, “Pam, living is traumatic.”
It validated experiences I have gone through personally and others with whom I am very close.
She is not wrong. Everything is a matter of degree of course.
<br> <br>
Q:<br>
How did you choose the three events you did for Your World?<br>
A:<br>
Oh, easy. Ugh! When I was eight, and in the 2nd grade, Martin Luther King Jr was tragically
assassinated and that was just really, really bad. I remember the expression on my teacher’s
face. She looked ill. My 2nd grade classmates and I l picked up her cues that this was a
watershed moment in our history.
We are impressionable at every age. Every age. Watch what you say in front of those under
your care. 
The plight of people of color has been so close to home for me as well. I grew up in the 60’s and
70’s reading Ebony magazine because my parents subscribed to it. My neighbors one block
over were actually wealthy African Americans with beautiful lawns and cars. They were so
together. But it was clear that the Civil Rights Movement was something that my parents
endorsed so much so that when I dated a black guy, my mother said to me, “Well, that’s fine. It’s
how you grew up.”
<br><br>
Q:<br>
What about Memorial Day and International Holocaust Remembrance Day (IHRD)? <br>
A:<br>
Memorial Day was an easy choice as well. I just feel that we have to know what war
heroes/veterans do for each of our countries-men and women on the front lines protecting us.
On a personal note, this section (Memorial Day in the U.S. and Israel or Remembrance Day
elsewhere) is my way to homage to my father in law, Irving Weissman, who served in the Battle
of Normandy in France during WWII as a 17 year old.
Orphaned (maternally) and poor, but wise and determined, he managed to get himself into
Cornell University with the GI Bill and then Fordham Law and with my mother in law raised an
incredible family. That man deserves props every day of our lives.
IHRD, was a no-brainer. Like I said, I am a bit of a “mess” from the persecution of my people.
And I have an agenda in the book to remind the world that this was a Jewish Problem, of course
but we were, in fact, not the only ones. So, for those who deny the Holocaust, well, if you are
Gay or Trans or Black or Gypsy or if you had differing beliefs at that time, then your life and all
your loved ones was soon to be terrorized during the Second World War.

Q: Word has it this that “Your World” was not the original title.
<br>
A: <br>
Ha. Yes! The title, get this, was originally “You are Holding the Book of Love.”

<br> <br>
Q:<br> Really? What is the evolution there?<br>
A:<br>
I still feel this way today. I always wanted my kids and my grandkids to have a
strong sense of security, firmly rooted and to know that we love them (for starters).
And by children, this eventually came to mean, my children’s partners as well.
So I wanted the actual object, the book itself to act as a soothing source of comfort.
That, just by reading it, by holding it, that they can feel that sense of security.--></p><br>

  <br> <br>
  <p class = "w3-left">Beginning with the Author's Note, I sat with my 17 year old who is one year away from leaving his nest and I just wanted to snuggle with him and read it to him. Even though he is so big!</p> 
  <p class=" w3-right"> <strong>  Rivka Bressler, 4th grade Instructor</strong> </p> <br>

  

  <p class="w3-left">Your World reads like a mindfulness exercise-recognizing the presence of the good and the bad. Most importantly, we are reminded that we can enable every child to contend with life's inevitable challenges by imbuing them with loving security. </p>

  <p class="w3-left">This is a masterpiece.  From the opening page I cried.  So beautifully worded and crafted, hitting this mother of new adults in just the right way.</p>

  <!--<p class="w3-left">A beautiful and important book.   As the reader is gently invited to grapple with some of the more tragic moments in our history, as well as the challenges we face in our interactions with others, the author lovingly reassures us that we can navigate even the most difficult experiences when we are securely attached, comforted, and connected to others.  Everything in life is more manageable when we don't have to face it alone: a powerful reminder to children and adults alike. </p>

    Lisa Ferentz, LCSW-C, DAPA <br>
    Author of Finding Your Ruby Slippers: Transformative Life Lesson From the Therapist’s Couch.</p> <br>
  <p class = "w3-left">As a pediatrician,  l feel that this important work brings families together. It opens the door of discussion when there is personal familial or societal loss. The book is suffused with warmth tenderness and insight. The beautiful imagery adds to the experience and helps parents and children talk openly. It is a treasure for children and adults of all ages</p>
<br>
<p class="w3-left">I am so honored that you shared your masterpiece with me.  I cannot wait to own a hard copy.

  As I had texted you, as soon as I read the opening page, I started to cry.  It is really the best of PFR Weissman.  All of your kind and calm and sweet come through.  It is beautifully worded and crafted.  And hit this mother of new adults (in age) in just the right way.
  <br> <br>
  I wish I had the right words to be able to express how beautiful your creation is.  The illustrations are perfect and the words are elevating and calming at the same time.  I so hope that you have great success with your book- if only to share your gospel.
  <br><br>
  We live in what feels like a scary and upside down world.  Feeling a hug, being reminded of it and the comfort of being held, is a great gift.  I will treasure this one always.</p>
